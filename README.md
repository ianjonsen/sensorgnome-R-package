A package of functions to help post-process tag-detection data obtained from sensorgnome.org

*Note:*  these functions don't work directly with the raw data files from a sensorgnome.  Those files have
to be zipped and sent to data@sensorgnome.org using http://wetransfer.com for central processing, which ensures
we look for everyone's tag in everyone's data.
